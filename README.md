This code is mainly developed as part of a specific course about finance and techology (for more information about the course, please visit http://www.polymtl.ca/etudes/cours/details.php?sigle=IND6953M%20%20). To learn more about PolyFinances and it's activities, please visit http://www.polyfinances.ca/.
